## Description

csv file containing 2 datasets analyzed by Marques-Toledo et al.
1- Dengue registered cases, Google Trends, Wikipedia Logs and Tweets with Dengue content (from Observatorio) aggregated per week for Brazil (2012 to 2016)
1- Dengue registered cases, Tweets with Dengue content (from Observatorio) aggregated per week for 266 cities in Brazil (2012 to 2016)

## Summary

In this study, we aimed to quantitatively assess the usefulness of data acquired by Twitter for the early detection and monitoring of Dengue epidemics, both at country and city level at a weekly basis. Here, we evaluated and demonstrated the potential of tweets modeling for
Dengue estimation and forecast, in comparison with other available web-based data, Google Trends and Wikipedia access logs. Also, we studied the factors that might influence the goodness-of-fit of the model. We built a simple model based on tweets that was able to `nowcast',
i.e. estimate disease numbers in the same week, but also `forecast' disease in future weeks. At the country level, tweets are strongly associated with Dengue cases, and can estimate present and future Dengue cases until 8 weeks in advance. At city level, tweets are
also useful for estimating Dengue activity. Our model can be applied successfully to small and less developed cities, suggesting a robust construction, even though it may be influenced by the incidence of the disease, the activity of Twitter locally, and social factors,
including human development index and internet access.
