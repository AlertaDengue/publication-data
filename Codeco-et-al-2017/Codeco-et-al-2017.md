## Description

Scripts and datasets analyzed by Codeço et al. Paper submitted to Epidemics (2017). 


## Summary

The study proposes a method that allows dengue's R_t estimates in the presence of temperature-mediated seasonality. This method is compared to the standard approach using both simulation and real datasets.
