## Description

csv file containing dataset analyzed by Mizzi et al. Paper submitted to Plos (2017). 


## Summary

Here, we investigate whether online data can be used to generate quicker estimates of the number of people currently infected with dengue in Rio de Janeiro. We outline a model that is operationally realistic and
could be deployed in practice, which draws on data from Google Trends and Twitter.
Our results provide evidence that rapidly available online data can be used to reduce uncertainty about disease spread, even where the underlying case count data is severely delayed.
